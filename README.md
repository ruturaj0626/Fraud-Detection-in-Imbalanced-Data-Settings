![Fraud Detection in Imbalanced Data Settings](Fraud Detection in Imbalanced Data Settings.png)

## Overview

This GitHub repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing fraud detection techniques in the context of imbalanced data settings. Fraud detection is a critical task across various domains, including finance, e-commerce, and healthcare. However, it often poses a significant challenge due to the inherent class imbalance, where the number of non-fraudulent transactions far outweighs the fraudulent ones.

## Key Features

- **Imbalanced Data Handling:** This repository provides various strategies and techniques for dealing with imbalanced datasets, such as resampling methods (oversampling and undersampling), cost-sensitive learning, and synthetic data generation.

- **Machine Learning Models:** We offer implementations of different machine learning algorithms suitable for fraud detection, including but not limited to logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, support vector machines, and ensemble methods like XGBoost and LightGBM.

- **Evaluation Metrics:** Understand how to evaluate model performance in imbalanced settings using metrics like precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, and the confusion matrix. We also provide insights into the trade-offs between these metrics.

- **Cross-Validation Strategies:** Learn about cross-validation techniques tailored for imbalanced datasets, including stratified k-fold and modified versions of k-fold validation.

- **Anomaly Detection:** Explore techniques for treating fraud detection as an anomaly detection problem, including the use of one-class SVM, isolation forests, and autoencoders.
